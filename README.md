E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational
pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health
if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit
points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.
